## ‚ö° Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: [Download here](https://nodejs.org)
- Firebase credentials 
  - Stored in a `.env` file for security reasons
  - Please refer to the "Setup" section below for instructions on how to obtain our Firebase credentials

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lisa-q/webapp_hwr
   cd webapp_hwr
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash 
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up Firebase:
  - For security reasons, the Firebase credentials are stored in a `.env` file and are not included in the repository.
  - The `.env` file should be placed in the backend folder and contain our Firebase credentials. The contents of this file can be found at the end of our submitted paper. 

4. Set up the backend:
  - Navigate to the `backend` folder: 
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
  - Install backend dependencies: 
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  - Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
5. Start the frontend application:
  - Open a new terminal and navigate back to the root folder:
      ```bash
      cd ..
      ```
  - Start the React application:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
