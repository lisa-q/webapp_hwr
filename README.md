All data is stored securely in Firebase.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: [Download here](https://nodejs.org)
- Firebase credentials 
  - Stored in a `.env` file for security reasons
  - Please refer to the "Setup" section below for instructions on how to obtain our Firebase credentials

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lisa-q/webapp_hwr
   cd webapp_hwr
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash 
    npm install
    ```

3. If the `node_modules` folder is not created, run the following command to install Vite and create the required folder:
    ```bash
    npm install vite
    ```

4. Set up Firebase:
  - For security reasons, the Firebase key is stored in a `.env` file and is not included in the repository.
  - The `.env` file should be placed in the root directory and contain our Firebase credentials. The contents of this file can be found at the end of our submitted paper.
